# ICA for Audio Signal Separation (Cocktail Party Problem)

This project demonstrates how to use Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate mixed audio signals, solving the classic Cocktail Party Problem. The Cocktail Party Problem refers to the challenge of isolating individual sound sources (like voices) from a mixed audio signal, just like trying to listen to one conversation in a noisy room.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:

Load and visualize mixed audio signals.

Apply ICA to separate the signals into independent components.

Reconstruct and save the separated signals as new audio files.

Play and visualize the separated audio to verify the results.


## How to Run

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ICA-audio-separation.git
```
Install required libraries:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
```

Place your mixed audio files (mix_1.wav, mix_2.wav, mix_3.wav) in the project directory.


Run the notebook cells step-by-step.

## Conclusion

This project provides a practical solution to the Cocktail Party Problem, using ICA to separate mixed audio signals into independent components. ICA is a powerful technique for signal processing and has many real-world applications in audio and speech analysis.
